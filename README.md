## Quick Start

### Ubuntu VPS (Fresh Install)

SSH into your server and run:

```bash
# 1. Install Node.js 22
curl -fsSL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_22.x | sudo -E bash -
sudo apt-get install -y nodejs

# 2. Install build tools (needed for some npm packages)
sudo apt-get install -y build-essential git python3 python3-pip

# 3. Clone Clawdboss
git clone https://github.com/NanoFlow-io/clawdboss.git
cd clawdboss

# 4. Run the setup wizard
./setup.sh
```

That's it. The wizard handles everything else — OpenClaw installation, API keys, agent creation, optional tools.

### What You'll Need Ready

- **An LLM provider** — one of:
  - [GitHub Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot) subscription (cheapest — uses copilot-api proxy)
  - [OpenAI API key](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys) (sk-...)
  - [Anthropic API key](https://console.anthropic.com/) (sk-ant-...)
- **A Discord bot token** — [create one here](https://discord.com/developers/applications) (if using Discord interface)
- **Optional:** Brave Search API key, ElevenLabs API key, OpenAI key for image gen/whisper

The setup wizard will:
1. Ask about **you** — name, role, what you do, how you want to use your agent
2. Ask about **your agent** — name, personality, mission, domain expertise
3. Prompt for your API keys and Discord credentials
4. Create your `.env` file (gitignored, never committed)
5. Generate `openclaw.json` with `${VAR}` references to your `.env`
6. Create agent workspaces with security rules + WAL Protocol pre-baked
7. Offer optional tools: Graphthulhu, ApiTap, Scrapling, GitHub, Playwright, OCTAVE, Humanizer, Self-Improving Agent, Find Skills, Marketing Skills, Healthcheck, Clawmetry, ClawSec
8. Run OpenClaw's built-in skills wizard (Whisper, Nano Banana Pro, mcporter, TTS, email, etc.)
9. Start the gateway

Your agent starts its first session knowing who you are, what you do, and what personality it should have — zero manual config file editing needed.

## Configuration Tiers

| Tier | Agents | Best For |
|------|--------|----------|
| **Solo** | Main only | Personal assistant, simple setups |
| **Team** | Main + 1-2 specialists | Small business, multiple workflows |
| **Full Squad** | Main + Comms + Research + Security | Full operations center |

## Interface Options

During setup, choose your preferred interface:

| Option | Best For |
|--------|----------|
| **Discord** | Power users who live in Discord. Channel-per-agent, reactions, threads. |
| **NanoFlow Console** | Visual dashboard with chat, file browser, terminal, cost analytics. Great for non-technical users. |
| **Both** | Use Discord for quick commands + Console for monitoring and file management. |

NanoFlow Console is a branded web dashboard built on [ClawSuite](https://github.com/outsourc-e/clawsuite) (MIT license).

## Context Persistence (WAL Protocol + 3-Layer Memory)

Clawdboss agents don't lose your corrections and decisions when context resets:

- **3-Layer Memory** — L1 (Brain, loaded every turn) → L2 (Memory, searched semantically) → L3 (Reference, opened on demand)
- **L1 File Budget** — 500-1,000 tokens per workspace file to prevent agents from skimming
- **SESSION-STATE.md** — Agent writes important details here BEFORE responding (Write-Ahead Log)
- **Working Buffer** — At ~60% context, every exchange is logged to survive compaction
- **Compaction Recovery** — Agent reads buffer + state files after context loss, never asks "what were we doing?"
- **Breadcrumbs** — Topic-organized files in `memory/` that point to deep reference docs
- **Trim** — Weekly maintenance to keep L1 files lean, move excess to L2/L3
- **Recalibrate** — Drift correction, forces re-read of all files and behavior comparison

See [docs/security.md](docs/security.md) for the full architecture.

## Security

All API keys are stored in `~/.openclaw/.env` and referenced via `${VAR_NAME}` syntax in the config. Keys never appear in JSON config files.

All agents come with:
- Prompt injection defense (content isolation, pattern detection)
- Anti-loop rules (prevent token-burning attacks)
- External content security (emails, web pages treated as data-only)
- Relentless resourcefulness + VBR (Verify Before Reporting)

See [docs/security.md](docs/security.md) for the full security architecture.
